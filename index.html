<p>ğŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Loris!</p>
<p>
  ğŸš€ I'm currently making regulatory compliance awesome at <a href="https://fundapps.co">FundApps</a>,
  where I spend lots of time thinking about scalable architecture,
  evolving codebases, and sustainable development.
</p>

<p>
  ğŸ’» I like to write open source desktop utilities. You can check them
  out on <a href="https://github.com/LBognanni">my GitHub</a>, or on <a href="https://codemade.net">my website</a>.
</p>

<p>
  ğŸ’¬ I don't often <a href="https://codemade.net/blog">blog</a> my thoughts and discoveries, but when I do I
  also tend to <a href="https://x.com/LBognanni">tweet</a> about them ğŸ˜„
